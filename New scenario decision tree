Identify scenario content
                    e.g. Neonatal resuscitation 
  Confirm version in use
                    e.g. 2016 Kenya guidelines
Construct algorithm for all possible correct management steps within scenario
  Consider key branch points
                    e.g. number of providers
  Subdivide algorithm into segments 
                    e.g. identifying equipment / ventilation technique
Identify every learning point: what must the learner demonstrate they have learned?
  Identify common errors for every learning point
Determine which generic template/s required for each learning point
Create file list for developer of algorithm including segments, learning points, generic templates, variables for each learning point template
Identify timestamps required
Identify analytics required
Review for learning efficacy:
  Minimised extraneous material
  Managed essential material (segmentation, recaps, text near visual)
  Promoted generative processing (psych engagement not just behavioural, topic mapping)
